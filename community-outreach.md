## Reddit Templates

### r/pregnant, r/BabyBumps  *(straightforward ask)*

**Title:** Honest question: what actually helps you as a first-time expecting mom? [8-min survey]

**Body:**
Hey everyone — I'm doing consumer research for a parenting product I'm building and I genuinely need your help getting it right.

I put together a short survey (8–10 minutes) for expecting and new moms. It's anonymous, there are no right or wrong answers, and I promise it's not just a bunch of product pitches disguised as questions.

I'm specifically trying to understand:
- What's actually frustrating about finding parenting information right now
- What sources you trust (and why)
- What a genuinely helpful resource would look like

If you have 10 minutes and want to shape what actually gets built, I'd really appreciate it:

Happy to share key findings back to the community when I have enough responses. Thanks in advance 🙏

### r/beyondthebump  *(more conversational, postpartum-aware)*

**Title:** Did you ever wish there was a parenting resource that just... kept up with your baby? Quick survey inside

**Body:**
Hi BtB — I've been lurking here while building something I hope could be genuinely useful for new parents, and I realized I need to hear directly from people who've been in the thick of it before I get too far.

Quick, anonymous survey — 8-10 minutes — for expecting moms and anyone with a baby under 6 months:

**[Survey link]**

The most important question is the last one, so if you only answer one thing, make it that one.

No spam, no follow-ups unless you opt in at the end. Just trying to build something that doesn't suck.

### r/pregnant  *(specific pain point hook)*

**Title:** How do you actually deal with conflicting advice? Building something to help — survey inside (anonymous, 8 min)

**Body:**
One thing I keep hearing from expecting moms is that the internet is full of conflicting advice and it's genuinely exhausting to figure out what to trust.

I'm working on a solution to this and want to make sure I'm solving the *actual* problem before I build the wrong thing. Would love your honest take:

**[Survey link]**

Anonymous. 8–10 minutes. Your answers will directly shape what gets built.

## Facebook Group Templates

### General parenting / expecting moms groups

**Post:**
Hi everyone! 👋

I'm doing research for a parenting resource I'm building and would love input from real expecting and new moms before I get too far into development.

If you have 8–10 minutes, I'd be so grateful for your honest perspective. The survey is completely anonymous — no names, no email required (unless you want a heads up when it launches).

📋 **[Survey link]**

Specifically looking for moms who are:
✓ Currently pregnant (any trimester)
✓ Recently gave birth (within the last 6 months)

Feel free to share with anyone who fits! Thank you so much 💛

### Smaller / more personal groups  *(warmer tone)*

**Post:**
Hey lovely people —

I'm quietly building something I hope will make the parenting journey a little less overwhelming, and I need your help making sure it's actually useful.

10-minute anonymous survey: **[Survey link]**

There's one question at the end that I'm especially curious about — it asks what would make you feel genuinely less stressed as a new parent. I've found that question gets really honest, sometimes really moving answers, and it's the one that matters most for what I'm building.

No pressure — only if you have the time and want to help shape something real. 🙏

## Posting Tips

**Timing:** Post in the evening on weekdays (7–9pm local time) or Sunday mornings. These communities are most active then.

**Engagement:** Check back within the first 30 minutes and reply to any comments — early engagement boosts visibility in Reddit's algorithm.

**Transparency:** If asked what you're building, be honest — you're building a personalized parenting resource. You don't need to give the name yet; "a parenting resource I'm working on" is sufficient and accurate.

**Goal:** Aim for n=50 organic responses before drawing conclusions. n=100 for reliable pricing and feature data. Paid panel (Respondent.io) responses are higher signal — weight them accordingly.

**Follow through:** If you promised to share findings, do it. It builds goodwill and often gets you a second wave of respondents.
